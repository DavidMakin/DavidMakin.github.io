I do other stuff.  

Yes but what other stuff?  

Well I enjoy Snowboarding
Ideally outdoors but that is only really once a year. I do live about 30 minutes away from the indoor ski slope in Manchester so that helps out.

I also enjoy climbing. Along with my wife we try to go once a week.  

Axe throwing. WHistlePunks in Manchester had a weekly league I was part of until Corona put an end to that :(
